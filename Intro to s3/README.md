### Add a Bucket Policy to Allow Public Access

1. Navigate to the **Permissions** tab.
2. Locate **Bucket Policy** and click **Edit**.
3. Add the following policy (replace `"your-bucket-name"` with your actual bucket name):

   ```json
   {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
         {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
         }
      ]
   }
   Click Save Changes.
   ```
